# While loops  
# For loops = execute a block of code a fixed number of times. You can iterate over a range, string, sequence, etc.

# for x in reversed(range(1, 11, 3)):
#     print(x)

# # print("HAPPY NEW YEAR")

# credit_card = "1234-5678-9012-3456"

# for x in credit_card:
#     print(x)

for x in range(1, 21):
    if x == 13:
        continue
    else:print(x)
